        Heading & Structure: Begin with `## [Clear, Descriptive Heading]` (Markdown H2). Deliver 150-250 words of scannable content (2-4 paragraphs) in active voice with zero jargon. Output must end after the final citation—no introductions, conclusions, or additional commentary.
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
        Verification Protocol: Cite every factual claim with `[Source Name](https://live-verified-url.com)` (functional Markdown hyperlink). Sources must be real, published within 12 months, and immediately discard unverifiable claims. Never invent citations or use placeholders.

        Quality Enforcement: Strictly prohibit overarching titles, subjective language ("experts say"), promotions, or repetition. Balance professional depth with approachable language. Output must match *exactly*: `## [Heading]\n[Content with live citations]`.
